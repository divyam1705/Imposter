## Inspiration
Our team was inspired by the desire to combine physical activity with gaming elements. We wanted to create an experience that encourages people to move around while enjoying the strategic and social aspects of gaming. Imposter brings the best of both worlds - staying fit while having fun with friends in an interactive real-world environment.

## What it does
Imposter is essentially "Among Us but in real life." The game brings the popular digital experience into the physical world, where players must complete tasks, identify impostors, and survive in a real-world setting. Players interact with their environment and each other through their mobile devices, creating an immersive gaming experience that unfolds in the real world.

## How we built it
We utilized a comprehensive tech stack to bring Imposter to life:
- Figma for UI design and prototyping
- React Native for mobile development
- Firebase for backend infrastructure and real-time updates
- NFC technology for physical interactions with game elements
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for proximity detection between players

## Challenges we ran into
Our development journey wasn't without obstacles:
- Implementing NFC reading and writing capabilities
- Integrating voice channel communication for player discussions
- Accurately measuring distance using Bluetooth RSSI signal strength
- Working with React Native CLI presented numerous technical hurdles
- Learning Figma on the fly to create polished UI designs
- Developing a real-time map that accurately reflects player positions
- Implementing reliable location tracking
- Debugging issues across multiple platforms and technologies
- Managing our excessive caffeine intake during the hackathon

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the challenges, we achieved significant milestones:
- Successfully implemented NFC reading and writing functionality
- Created a working voice channel for player communication
- Established reliable Bluetooth connections for proximity detection
- Achieved our Minimum Viable Product within the hackathon timeframe
- Implemented numerous real-time features that enhance gameplay experience

## What we learned
The hackathon was a tremendous learning opportunity:
- Gained proficiency in Figma for UI/UX design
- Developed PATIENCE when facing technical challenges
- Strengthened our teamwork and collaboration skills
- Discovered that React Native presents more challenges compared to standard React development

## What's next for Imposter
We have exciting plans for future development:
- Adding a "corrupt" feature to introduce new gameplay mechanics
- Implementing AI to generate tasks for crew members to solve
- Integrating AR technology for collectible items in the physical world
- Developing a dynamic zone-shrinking map based on time elapsed, adding urgency to gameplay
